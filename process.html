            <p class="right">Melanina Essential Oils are delicately distilled from plants that have been carefully
              harvested by experienced ethical growers from around the world for ideal extract composition and efficacy.
              The method of extracting essential oils is a low-heat steam distillation process. In this process, pressurized
              steam is circulated through plant material. The essential oils are liberated from the plant and carried away by the steam.
              When the steam cools, the water and oils naturally separate and the oil is collected. This delicate process insures the highest
              quality oil extract with the correct chemical composition.</p>
